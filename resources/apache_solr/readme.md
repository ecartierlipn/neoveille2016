This directory contains example configurations for collections in Apache Solr. You can use them as examples. One zip file works with Apache Solr 5.x and the other one for Apache Solr 7.5+.

# Installation
You just need to unzip the files into the collection directory of your Apache Solr installation ```<solr installation directory>/server/solr```. From here just type (Linux) :


```
tar -xzvf <zip file>
```
